    <h2>처음 만드는 HTML Page</h2>
    <p>This is <strong>the very <u>first</u></strong> html file that I made. I've thought <a href="https://blog.naver.com/ehd_rua1004" target="_blank">my career path</a> so seriously because I don't think I want to do something with my major, economics. Recently, I've started studying statistics, data analysis and front-end engineering. I really hope to make my decision soon.</p>

    <p>This part is for applying 'br' tag. So Let's see if this really works. There are a lot lof kinds of tags in html so I wonder how many time do I need to get used to it but I'm pretty sure I could do it very soon.</p>
